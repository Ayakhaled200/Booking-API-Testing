## 🧩 Running the Collection with Newman

You can run automated API tests using Newman in various modes.

**Basic execution:**
newman run "Booking API collection.json" -e "Booking API env.json"

This runs all requests and test scripts defined in the collection against the specified environment. Results include request URLs, status codes, response times, and assertions.

**Generate HTML and JSON reports:**
newman run "Booking API collection.json" -e "Booking API env.json" -r cli,html,json

This produces:
- A terminal report
- An HTML report (`newman-report.html`)
- A JSON report (`newman-run-report.json`)

**Generate enhanced HTML report:**
newman run "Booking API collection.json" -e "Booking API env.json" -r htmlextra

This generates a styled HTML report with collapsible sections and detailed logs.

## 🔄 Running Data-Driven Tests

**Using CSV:**
newman run "Booking API collection.json" -e "Booking API env.json" --iteration-data "TestDataFiles/testdatacsv.csv"
**Using JSON:**
newman run "Booking API collection.json" -e "Booking API env.json" --iteration-data "TestDataFiles/testdatajson.json"

These commands iterate over the data file rows and execute the collection for each set of data.

## 🛠️ Running via Jenkins

This project includes a sample Jenkins job configuration (`BookingAPI_JenkinsJob1.txt`).

**Example Windows batch command:**
newman run "%WORKSPACE%\Booking API collection.json" -e "%WORKSPACE%\Booking API env.json"
This allows you to integrate API testing into your CI/CD pipeline and generate reports automatically with each build.

## 📊 Reports

Newman reports are included in the `Newman Reports` folder:
- `newman_report-basic.html`: Standard HTML report
- `newman-report-htmlextra.html`: Enhanced, styled HTML report
